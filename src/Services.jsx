          <h3>UI # UX Design</h3>
          <p>
            I begin by creating a preliminary wireframe to give the client a clear idea of the website's structure. &
            I present the wireframe for feedback and ensure it aligns with the clientâ€™s vision. &
            Once the client approves the wireframe, I proceed with designing the full website. &
            I make sure the final design reflects the approved layout and meets all project objectives.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
          I build dynamic web applications using the React framework, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
          I utilize React libraries such as React Router for seamless navigation, Redux for state 
          management, and Axios for handling API requests. Additionally, I incorporate modern styling 
          libraries like Sass for CSS preprocessing and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling to ensure 
          efficient, responsive designs. React's component-based architecture, paired with these libraries, 
          allows me to create reusable, scalable, and maintainable UI components.
